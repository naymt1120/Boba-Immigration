* Use the U.S. Census Bureau's Statistical Testing Tool to test whether American Community Survey (ACS) annual estimates are statistically different from one another. The testing tool is available here: https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/data/data-tables-and-tools/statistical-testing-tool.html.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

NOTES:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"1) The term ""immigrants"" (also known as the foreign born) refers to people residing in the United States who were not U.S. citizens at birth. This population includes naturalized citizens, lawful permanent residents (LPRs), certain legal nonimmigrants (e.g., persons on student or work visas), those admitted under refugee or asylee status, and persons illegally residing in the United States.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2) The total count of the foreign born in 2006 through 2016 excludes those born at the sea.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3) ACS data are based on a sample and are subject to sampling variability. The degree of uncertainty for an estimate arising from sampling variability is represented through the use of a margin of error. The value shown here is the 90 percent margin of error. The margin of error can be interpreted roughly as providing a 90 percent probability that the interval defined by the estimate minus the margin of error and the estimate plus the margin of error (the lower and upper confidence bounds) contains the true value. The Decennial 2000 sample was significantly larger than the ACS sample; no margins of error are available for Census 2000 estimates.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"4) The noticeable increase in the number of the foreign born between 2009 and 2010 is partly attributed to changes in population weights between the two years (with ACS data prior to 2010 weighted to the 2000 Census, while the 2010 ACS is weighted to the 2010 Census). Higher response rates associated with the increased marketing and visibility surrounding the Decennial Census 2010 year likely also contributed to the shifts between the 2009 and 2010 ACS.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5) - Not available.; n.e.c. Not elsewhere classified.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"6) Denmark, Norway, Belgium, Switzerland, Albania, Bulgaria, Croatia, Latvia, Lithuania, Moldova, Serbia, Nepal, Singapore, Sri Lanka, Uzbekistan, Burma, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Cameroon, Cape Verde, Liberia, Kenya, Morocco, Sudan, Bahamas, Dominica, Grenada, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, and Uruguay added from Integrated Public Use Microdata Series for the 2000 Decennial Census (5% sample).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"7) From 2006 on, ""Oceania, n.e.c. "" included Melanesia, Micronesia, and Polynesia.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
