Topic: Growth of Boba and Immigration in the Bay Area?
Proposal Question: 
Does the growth of boba shops in the Bay Area reflect any patterns in immigration from the countries that originated boba (Taiwan? Hong Kong? Korea?)?
Sub Questions:
Do we see a growth in immigration from the countries that originated boba/bubble tea?
What boba chains are most popular in the Bay Area vs. rest of US?
Compared the the store growth trend with the area with high and low immigrants population.

Resources:
Boba Shops in the Bay Area - Kaggle Dataset
Yelp API
Census API
Data.Gov API
Websites of Boba chains to see shops in US (Gongcha, Sharetea, Boba Guys, etc.)

Backup Plan → Focus on tea industry as a whole and immigration in Bay Area/ US
 
Requirements of the Project:
Your visualization must include a Python Flask powered RESTful API, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and at least one database (MySQL, MongoDB, SQLite, etc.)
Your project should fall into one of the below four tracks:
•        A custom "creative" D3.js project (i.e. non-standard graph or chart)
•        A combination of Web Scraping and Leaflet or Plotly
•        A dashboard page with multiple charts all updating from the same data
•        A "thick" server that performs multiple manipulations on data in a database prior to visualization (must be approved)
Your project should include at least one JS library that we did not cover.
Your project must be powered by a dataset with at least 100 records.
Your project must include some level of user-driven interaction (e.g. menus, dropdowns, textboxes, etc.)
Your final visualization should ideally include at least three views
